hello hello hello
My name is Jacob and I work with computers
The computers I work with sometimes give me trouble
When I am given trouble, I decide to take a break
Coming back to the computer with a fresh mind helps a lot
Sometimes a fresh beverage or snack is also helpful
I don't mind the trouble as much as the work in the first place
